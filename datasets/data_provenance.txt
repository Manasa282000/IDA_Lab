Data Provenance for the datasets in this folder:

All datasets are the same as those used in the guessing threshold experiments, and are unmodified (except for potential renaming of some files - this is 
noted in a separate read-me file for each dataset where it happens, and follows the automated process outlined in fetchFolds.py). 

Additional files may be added to each folder representing the predictions for each example in data.csv based on a black box model.
